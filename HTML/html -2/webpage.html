      <h2 class="head"><span>Biography</span></h2>
      <p>
        Born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk is a South
        African-Canadian entrepreneur, inventor, and business magnate. He became a
        millionaire by age 31 after selling PayPal, a digital payment service, for
        over $1 billion. Musk’s parents divorced when he was 10, and he moved to
        Canada at 17 to attend Queen’s University. He earned a degree in economics
        and physics in 1992. His interest in computers and software led him to
        teach himself programming and create his first software game, Blastar, at
        12. Elon Musk’s entrepreneurial spirit, innovative thinking, and vision
        for a sustainable future have made him a global icon and a driving force
        in shaping the future of technology, transportation, and energy.
